And he wanted her to tell him something&mdash;anything&mdash;about herself, to whisper some secret about what it meant to be Aomame, what it meant to be a ten-year-old girl.

They couldn't get out, nor could anyone else come in. The two of them didn't know it at the time, but this was the only truly complete place in the entire world. Totally isolated, yet the one place not tainted with loneliness."
